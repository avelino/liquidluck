Installation
============

If you are familiar with Python, it is strongly suggested that you install
everything in virtualenv.

If you are a pythoner, and you have no idea about virtualenv, please do search
the internet.

Distribute and Pip
------------------

If you are on Linux or Mac OS X, you are the lucky one::

    $ sudo pip -U install liquidluck

If no pip available, try easy_install::

    $ sudo easy_install -U liquidluck


Sorry, I have no knowledge about Windows, but it really works on Windows.
Cygwin and MinGW would make a better life with UNIX software on Windows.


Install with GIT
-----------------

If you prefer git, that is great. You can get the very latest code at GitHub::

    $ git clone http://github.com/lepture/liquidluck.git


Mac User Attention
---------------------

We use misaka_ (python wrapper for sundown_) as the Markdown engine. It requires
C compiler, which means you should install Xcode.

Then open Xcode's preference (command + ,), select `Downloads` tab, and install
`Command Line Tools`.

I strongly suggest that you install the `Command Line Tools`, even if you don't
use Felix Felicis. You will need it somewhere else.

Install on Windows
-------------------

It is strongly suggested that you use Cygwin_ as the environment.

You should install these packages:

- python interpreters 2.x (or 3.x)
- make (Devel -- the GNU version of make)
- gcc (gcc-core and gcc-g++)
- git (Devel -- Fast version control ....)
- ca-certificates

Then head over to setuptools_ and install it, you will get ``easy_install``.
